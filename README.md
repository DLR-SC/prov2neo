# WIP: prov2neo - Import W3C PROV graphs into Neo4j.
Faster graph imports than comparable libs such as prov-db-connector.  
Implementation is tailored towards the provenance model used by gitlab2prov.  
Therefore it does not serve as a general purpose provenance tool.  
Unlike prov-db-connector, there is no option to retrieve stored documents.
